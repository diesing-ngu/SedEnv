# Predicted sedimentary environments on the Norwegian continental margin

Spatial prediction of the sedimentary environment on the Norwegian continental margin based on regional manual maps developed by the Geological Survey of Norway as part of the seafloor mapping programme [MAREANO](https://mareano.no/en). The original classification contained  six classes of depositional environment. These were simplified to the following three classes (original classes in brackets):

**Deposition from suspension** (includes deposition from suspension; deposition from suspension, local erosion of fine-grained sediments)

**Erosion or transport** (includes deposition from bottom currents; erosion, local deposition of sediments in topographic lows; erosion)

**No or very slow deposition** (includes no or very slow deposition)


### Model outputs ###

The following outputs are provided:

* Predicted sedimentary environments as defined above

* Prediction probabilities of the three sedimentary environments

* Maximum probabilities, i.e., the probability of the class that was mapped. Can be used as an indicator of map confidence.

* Area of applicability of the model [(Meyer & Pebesma, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13650)
